* The code provides an analysis pipeline for differential gene expression and survival analysis of prostate cancer data from the TCGA-PRAD project. These steps are based on my preferences and research objectives, and parameters (e.g., logFC cutoff, p-value thresholds) can be adjusted to explore different aspects of the data or apply to different datasets.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please open a new issue.
